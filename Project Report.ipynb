    "   - The labels are integers from 0 to 9, making it a multi-class classification problem.  \n",
    "   - The pixel values typically need normalization (dividing by 255) before training neural networks.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Feature Engineering & Preprocessing Insights:  \n",
    "   - Since the dataset is already preprocessed, minimal cleaning is required.  \n",
    "   - However, reshaping is needed for deep learning models like CNNs:  \n",
    "   \n",
    "   ---\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "         x_train = x_train.reshape(-1, 28, 28, 1)  # Adding a channel dimension for CNN  \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Edge Detection Techniques \n",
    "We applied different edge detection filters to emphasize the structural details of the digits:  \n",
    "- Sobel Edge Detection: Computes gradients in both x and y directions to highlight edges.  \n",
    "- Prewitt Edge Detection Similar to Sobel but with a different kernel, used for detecting vertical and horizontal edges.  \n",
    "- Canny Edge Detection Detects strong edges by applying Gaussian smoothing followed by edge gradient calculations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Smoothing Techniques  \n",
    "To reduce noise and improve feature clarity, the following smoothing methods were used:  \n",
    "- Gaussian Smoothing Applied a Gaussian filter to blur the images and reduce high-frequency noise.  \n",
    "- Median Filtering Used a median filter to preserve edges while eliminating noise, especially useful for handwritten digits.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Thresholding for Binary Conversion  \n",
    "After edge detection and smoothing, we applied binary thresholding to segment the digits:  \n",
    "- Defined a threshold range (50-200) with a step size of 10.  \n",
    "- Converted pixels above the threshold to 1 (white) and below the threshold to 0 (black).  \n",
    "- This helped in standardizing pixel intensity variations across images.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Final Image Processing Pipeline  \n",
    "The images were preprocessed using a custom pipeline where:  \n",
    "- Edge detection or smoothing techniques (such as Gaussian smoothing) were applied.  \n",
    "- Binary thresholding was performed to enhance digit visibility.  \n",
    "- The final processed images were used for model training and testing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "By applying this structured preprocessing approach, we ensured better feature extraction and improved classification accuracy.   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Adding Gaussian Noise  \n",
    "\n",
    "To introduce robustness and make the models more resilient to real-world variations, we added Gaussian noise to the processed images. This technique helps the models generalize better by simulating imperfections in handwritten digits.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Methodology:  \n",
    "- A small fraction (10% of pixels) in the images was randomly selected.  \n",
    "- These selected pixels were replaced with random binary values (0 or 1) to simulate noise.  \n",
    "- The function `add_gaussian_noise()` was applied to both training and testing datasets.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Purpose of Adding Noise:  \n",
    "- Helps models learn to distinguish actual digits from noise.  \n",
